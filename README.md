# Dwarferizer - *Lossless Compression Algorithm*

## General description
Input data are interpreted in different ways and the algorithm is searching for the same parts then. There are two compression methods - it helps to find the best combination (*method - parameters of the method - interpretation*), which makes data the smallest. After this are computed the most ideal combinations of this combinations to get the most interesting compression ratio - it means, unfortunatelly, when working with huge amount of data, it's needed to have enough computer power. On the contrary, decompression should be really fast and simple process.
